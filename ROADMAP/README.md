## What This Roadmap Covers

This is not a generic startup guide. Every section is written specifically for ggLobby — its current codebase, its tech stack, its target audience, and its competitive landscape.

| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|---------------|
| [01 - Current State](./01-CURRENT-STATE.md) | Everything we have built. Full feature inventory, tech stack, database schema, integrations, and what's production-ready vs needs work. |
| [02 - Launch Checklist](./02-LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md) | What MUST be done before going live. Legal, SEO, branding, testing, security, and infrastructure setup. |
| [03 - Growth Strategy](./03-GROWTH-STRATEGY.md) | How to get the first 100 users, then 1,000, then 10,000. Specific marketing channels, community building tactics, content strategy, and partnerships — all for the gaming audience. |
| [04 - Scaling Plan](./04-SCALING-PLAN.md) | Technical scaling roadmap. Database optimization, caching, real-time architecture, background jobs, and when to upgrade infrastructure. |
| [05 - Monetization](./05-MONETIZATION.md) | Revenue strategy. What to charge for, what stays free, pricing tiers, battle pass economics, and when to start monetizing. |
| [06 - Costs & Budget](./06-COSTS-AND-BUDGET.md) | Real dollar amounts. Infrastructure costs at 100, 1K, 10K, and 100K users. Cheapest possible stack vs recommended stack. Third-party service costs. |
| [07 - Milestones](./07-MILESTONES.md) | The master timeline. Milestones organized by user count, with specific deliverables, metrics to track, and decision points at each stage. |

## The 30-Second Pitch

ggLobby is a social platform built exclusively for gamers. Unlike Discord (which is a chat app that gamers use) or Reddit (which is a forum that gamers use), ggLobby is purpose-built for the gaming lifestyle:

- **Find teammates** who match your skill level, playstyle, and schedule
- **Join or create clans** with built-in management, challenges, and leaderboards
- **Build a gamer profile** that showcases your stats, ranks, and achievements across all your games
- **Compete** in tournaments, climb leaderboards, and earn rewards
- **Create content** — write guides, share clips, post in forums
- **Stay connected** with voice/video calls, messaging, and a real-time activity feed

The platform already exists. The code is written. Now it needs users.
